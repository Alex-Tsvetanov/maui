# Parity review — open items needing a user ruling

Per `port/CLAUDE.md` ruling 3: a MAUI-side quirk not covered by rulings 1–10 is recorded here with its
evidence and **paused for a ruling** — neither auto-ignored nor auto-fixed. Approved rulings get appended
to the list in `port/CLAUDE.md`.

---

## 1. ✅ RESOLVED (2026-07-16) — `src/` vs SHIPPED MAUI CheckBox sizing: the RENDER wins

**Ruling (user, 2026-07-16): the render wins — drop the 44 floor.** Now `port/CLAUDE.md` ruling 11.
Implemented: `check_box_handler.mm` `minimumViewSize = k_default_size` (18pt, not 44). Verified on the
Catalyst board — `entry` +20px → **0 / 0.00**, `border_playground` → **0 / 0.37**; the checkbox row is now
18pt, its content bands identical to MAUI (150/183/209/219). Headless 3765/3765; iOS 10/2331 (== baseline,
no regression). The original analysis is kept below for the record.

### The measurement

`entry` is a **+20px pure offset** — but only for the block `y=160..460`; above and below it, the port
matches MAUI exactly (residual **0.00**). The divergence starts at one element: the page's
`<CheckBox IsChecked="True" />` (`port/maui-reference/pages/entry.xaml:9`).

Measured geometry, from the captures (spacing calibrated from the entry pitch, not assumed):

| | checkbox row |
| --- | --- |
| MAUI **Mac Catalyst** — gap between the bracketing Entry borders `150 → 183` = 33px, minus 2× spacing (9.5px) | **14px ≈ 18pt** |
| MAUI **iOS** (1:1, no Catalyst scale) — `216.7 → 259.0` = 42.3pt, minus 2× spacing (12.3pt) | **17.7pt ≈ 18pt** |
| **the port** (Catalyst) — `150 → 203` = 53px, minus 2× spacing | **34px ≈ 44pt** |

44 − 18 = 26pt = **20.02px** at the 0.77 Catalyst UIKit scale — exactly the measured offset. The glyph
itself is identical (14px) in both; only the row differs. MAUI renders 18pt on **both** platforms, so this
is **not** a Mac Catalyst "renders-less" quirk (ruling 10).

### The conflict

- **`src/` (the documented behavior oracle) says 44.** `CheckBoxHandler.iOS.cs:8` `protected virtual float
  MinimumSize => 44f`, applied via `CreatePlatformView`'s `MinimumViewSize = MinimumSize`, and
  `MauiCheckBox.SizeThatFits` (`:245-253`) floors both axes at it:
  `final = Min(Max(MinimumViewSize, h), Max(MinimumViewSize, w))` ⇒ ≥ 44. iOS's
  `ViewHandlerExtensions.iOS.GetDesiredSizeFromHandler` does call `SizeThatFits`, so this path is live.
  There is no override of `MinimumSize` anywhere in `src/` (Compatibility excluded), and the
  Controls-level `CheckBox.Mapper.cs` only remaps `Color` — it does not touch the measure.
- **The shipped MAUI renders 18** = `MauiCheckBox.DefaultSize` (`:13` `const float DefaultSize = 18.0f`),
  i.e. the natural size with **no floor applied**.

**Why they differ:** they are different MAUI versions. `src/`'s `MauiCheckBox.cs` was last modified
**2025-01-26** (`2b0d66669c`), while `port/maui-reference/app/MauiReference.csproj:12` pins
**`<MauiVersion>10.0.71</MauiVersion>`** — a much newer NuGet. The port is written against `src/`; the
ground-truth captures are rendered by 10.0.71.

The port already ports the `src/` rule faithfully (`check_box_handler.mm:245-253` mirrors
`SizeThatFits`; `:340` sets `minimumViewSize = 44.0`), which is exactly why it renders 44.

### The fork (why this is not mine to pick)

The two authorities point opposite ways and this case is not covered by rulings 1–10:

- **`port/CLAUDE.md` prime directive** — `src/` is the behavior oracle; "no invented behavior… don't ship
  a guess". Following it ⇒ keep 44, accept `entry` staying red vs the reference.
- **Ruling 1** — "Microsoft's MAUI render IS the ground truth for all page CONTENT… any content
  difference vs MAUI is a port bug to fix". Following it ⇒ drop the floor so the port renders 18.

Ruling 1 was written about MAUI's *rendered demos* vs the port, not about `src/` contradicting the shipped
binary, so applying it here would extend it. Picking either silently would be a guess about a MAUI version
I cannot read.

### What I need

A ruling on the general question, since this will recur wherever the 2025 `src/` snapshot and the 10.0.71
NuGet have diverged:

1. **When `src/` and the shipped `MauiVersion` disagree, which wins?** (My recommendation: **the render**,
   per ruling 1 — the board's whole purpose is matching what MAUI actually draws; `src/` is then the
   oracle only for *mechanism*, not for values it has since changed.) If so, I'd drop the 44 floor with a
   comment recording that `src/` says otherwise and why.
2. Or: **bump `src/`** to the 10.0.71 tag so the oracle and the reference agree (larger, but removes the
   whole class of conflict).
3. Or: **pin the reference app to a MAUI matching `src/`** (~2025) so the captures match the oracle.

Until then `entry` is 🟡 blocked, not 🔴. Everything else on the page matches at residual 0.00.

**Evidence to reproduce:**
```
python3 port/cpp/tools/parity/capture_ios_clean.py --app maui --themes light --only entry   # MAUI iOS
# then measure the Entry borders bracketing the CheckBox in a text-free column.
```

## 2. 🟡 `nested_collection` cpp_xaml blank — XAML loader can't realize a nested templated CollectionView

**Status:** open — larger framework work, not a ruling. The last genuinely-open macOS red
(`nested_collection`, 3.64% — mostly white). NOT a port rendering bug: the port's own framework renders
it correctly (see below); the gap is specific to the **compile-time-XAML loader**.

### The finding

`nested_collection.xaml` is an OUTER `CollectionView` (VerticalList) whose ItemTemplate root is an INNER
`CollectionView` (HorizontalList, HeightRequest=100) with its own `Header="{Binding Title}"`,
HeaderTemplate, `ItemsSource="{Binding Items}"`, and ItemTemplate (`{Binding Caption}`). The outer
ItemsSource is assigned in **code-behind** (NestedCollectionPage.xaml.cs), not in the XAML.

Measured (clean captures): `maui` 72 content rows, `cpp` (code-first) 102 content rows — both render
fully; **`xaml` 0 content rows — completely blank** (only the banner).

### Two-part cause — part 1 fixed locally, part 2 is the blocker

- **Part 1 (data — SOLVED, but reverted with part 2).** cpp_xaml used `build_page<no_view_model, …>` so
  the outer CV had NO source. I built the `super_teams`-style bindable VM (`ViewModels/nested_sources.hpp`:
  `gallery_item` with a registered `Caption`, `nested_source` with `Title` + `Items`) and wired
  `nested_collection.xaml.cpp` (`find<collection_view>("CollectionView")` → `set_items_source`). VERIFIED
  by diagnostic: `find` succeeds, **20 items set, `item_template` + `items_layout` both present**.
- **Part 2 (rendering — THE BLOCKER).** With all of the above set, the outer CV STILL realizes **zero
  cells**. `basic_grouping` uses the identical late-`set_items_source` pattern and renders, so it is not a
  data/timing issue — the XAML loader cannot **realize an outer cell whose DataTemplate root is a nested
  CollectionView** (with its own Header/ItemTemplate + `{Binding Items}`). The code-first `cpp` column
  builds that template in C++ (`data_template::of<collection_view>()` + `add_setup` for the inner
  ItemsLayout, which "is a plain slot, NOT a bindable_property, so it cannot be staged through the
  template's Values" — nested_collection_page.hpp) and works; the XAML template-inflater path does not.

The part-1 VM was reverted because alone it produces NO board change (still blank) — shipping it would be
correct-but-dead code implying progress. It is ~80 lines following `super_teams.hpp` and trivially
recreated alongside the loader work.

### What it needs

XAML-loader support for realizing a DataTemplate whose root is a templated `CollectionView` — staging the
inner CV's non-bindable `ItemsLayout`, its `{Binding Items}`/`{Binding Title}` against each outer item's
binding context, and its own Header/ItemTemplate. This is a real layer-6 feature, not a page tweak; the
port's framework (cpp) already renders the page, so it is a demo-column-only gap at low pixel impact.

**Evidence to reproduce:** wire the VM as above, add `fprintf(stderr, …)` after `set_items_source`, launch
`gallery_xaml` with `MAUI_SAMPLE_PAGE=nested_collection` and stderr redirected — shows 20 items +
item_template set, render still blank.

## 3. 🟡 MAUI's CollectionView FRAME is inset on Mac Catalyst but not iOS (informational — fix landed platform-forked)

**Status:** open observation, not blocking. The CV `.Never` fix (iOS, big win — 47%→~9%, 3 pages green)
had to be **forked by platform** and this records why, so a future frame-level fix can unify it.

### The finding

C# `ItemsViewController2.ViewDidLoad` (:163-183) sets `ContentInsetAdjustmentBehavior = .Never` on iOS 11+
AND Mac Catalyst 11+ (one code path, both platforms). Yet MAUI *renders* the two differently, measured:
- **iOS:** the CV content goes edge-to-edge UNDER the status bar (group header at y=0, the view-level
  Header scrolled out of sight). `.Never` matches; the UIKit default `.automatic` insets below the safe
  area and puts the whole CV a status-bar height low (the 8-page cluster, 35-47%).
- **Mac Catalyst:** the CV content sits BELOW the titlebar. The port's page-direct CV, arranged over full
  bounds (the U20 safe-area slice), reproduces that only with `.automatic` (green 0.12%); forcing `.Never`
  moves content under the titlebar and regresses to red 44%.

### The implication

Same C# line, different render ⇒ MAUI's CV **frame** (or its host's safe-area handling) must be inset on
Catalyst but NOT iOS — with `.Never` on both, the only remaining variable is the frame the CV is laid into.
The port arranges a page-direct CV over full bounds on both backends, so today `.automatic` is what happens
to supply Catalyst's inset. The landed fix forks `#if !TARGET_OS_MACCATALYST` (contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior
= .Never on iOS only), which matches BOTH renders (ruling 1). A cleaner future fix would inset the CV's
FRAME on Catalyst (matching MAUI's actual mechanism) and then set `.Never` uniformly as C# does; that needs
locating why MAUI's Catalyst CV frame is inset (likely the page/host safe-area path the U20 work touched).

### Residual after the iOS fix (separate, smaller)

The 3 still-red grouping pages (~9%) are a per-group-header height difference: the port's green group-header
band is 60px @3x (20.0pt) vs MAUI's 58px (19.33pt), accumulating +2px per group. A 2px shift of full-width
colored bands reads as 100%-different rows, inflating the pixel-%. Separate root cause (group-header cell
sizing), tracked for a later pass.

## RadioButton indicator ring on iOS-3× — native-fallback limitation (2026-07-17)

**Status:** recorded (native-fallback architecture limit); Catalyst greened, iOS residual left minor.

The port renders `RadioButton` on the iOS backend as a native `UIButton` + SF-symbol pair (`circle` /
`smallcircle.filled.circle`) — NOT the C# DefaultTemplate (`Border`→`Grid`→`Ellipse 21x21` +
`ContentPresenter`, `RadioButton.cs:516-635`). That template port is deferred. Two consequences on
`radio_button_content`:

1. **Wrapped indicator shrinks (unfixed).** MAUI's ring is a fixed 21x21 `Ellipse` (63px @3×), invariant to
   content. UIButton renders the SF-symbol at 21pt (63px) for a single-line title but shrinks it to ~17pt
   (51px) once the title WRAPS to multiple lines (the `<Frame>`-wrapped "Can't use View…" radio). Attempts:
   - `preferredSymbolConfiguration configurationWithFont:21` → holds the ring at 63px BUT enlarges the
     symbol's layout box, inflating single-line rows +14px each (regression, reverted).
   - `imageView.contentMode = UIViewContentModeCenter` → no effect on the symbol size (reverted).
   No clean fix exists without porting the ControlTemplate (the real Ellipse) or a fragile config hack.

2. **Wrapped-height double-count + cpp padding (FIXED — see STATUS 2026-07-17).** These landed: the Frame box
   went 304→297px and the cpp twin got `Padding=16`. Catalyst `radio_button_content` is now GREEN on both
   columns (cpp 0.48%, xaml 0.51%).

**Net:** on **Mac Catalyst (0.77×)** the residual ring-AA is absorbed → green. On **iOS (3×)** the 51-vs-63
wrapped ring plus font anti-aliasing keep `radio_button_content` (~5%), `radio_content_properties` (~6%,
custom Baskerville/Arial fonts + CharacterSpacing at 3×), and `radio_button_group_gallery` (~5%) red — all
minor, dominated by high-DPI rendering the native fallback can't match pixel-for-pixel. The deferred
RadioButton ControlTemplate port is the proper settlement. Not a per-page port bug beyond what landed.

## Gesture animated-gif cluster on iOS — capture-infrastructure gap (2026-07-17)

**Status:** recorded (capture-tooling gap); static content verified correct; NOT a port rendering bug.

`pointer_gesture` (xaml 10.55% / cpp 0.11%), `gestures` (5.09% / 0.24%), `ios_swipe_transition` (~5.9%)
score against the animated `.gif` capture (build_comparison_json prefers `.gif` over `.png`; the scorer
`Image.open`s frame 0). But the **port's gesture gifs are single-frame** while MAUI's are driven animations
(measured: `pointer_gesture` maui **13 frames**, cpp **1**, xaml **1**) — the port's capture does not INJECT
the pointer/hover/gesture interaction, so it records the resting frame only. Comparing a 1-frame static port
capture to MAUI's animation frame-0 is non-representative: `cpp` coincidentally matches MAUI's frame-0
(0.11% "green"), `xaml` happens to catch a different resting frame (10.55% "red") — a frame-timing artifact,
NOT a real cpp-vs-xaml difference (their static PNGs are **0.05%** apart, i.e. identical; both are ~2.6% off
MAUI's resting frame = the pointer-trail state MAUI's driven capture leaves behind).

The port renders these pages' static content correctly. The fix is capture-infrastructure: drive the
pointer/gesture interaction for the port apps during gif capture (MAUI's own capture does this), so the port
produces a comparable multi-frame animation. That injection path does not exist yet for the port's iOS gif
capture. NOTE: a blanket "score PNG not GIF" scorer change is WRONG — some port gifs ARE valid animations
(cpp `activity_indicator`; xaml `activity_indicator`/`empty_view_load_simulate`/`swipe_item_position`), so
the gif comparison is meaningful there. Per-page capture-driving is the correct fix. Deferred.

## scroll_to_group on iOS — Grid rows 6pt tighter than shipped MAUI (2026-07-17)

**Status:** diagnosed; ruling-11 (render-vs-src) Grid divergence; fix is board-wide → escalate.

`scroll_to_group` (5.84%) is a CLEAN uniform −72px offset: rings/CV below align at residual ~0 once
shifted; the top form (two 3-row/2-col Grids of Label+Entry, ScrollToGroup.xaml) is 72px SHORTER in the
port. Root-caused to the Grid row height: each of the 4 entry-row gaps is ~6pt (18px @3×) tighter in the
port than in MAUI (4 × 18px = 72px).

Measured/probed on the iOS-26 simulator (the same sim that shot the MAUI reference):
- The Entry's visible box (33.7pt) and the "0" glyph (14pt font) are IDENTICAL between MAUI and the port.
- A **bare RoundedRect UITextField `sizeThatFits` returns 34pt, FIXED across font sizes** (14pt→37×34,
  17pt→39×34, default→39×34) — only width tracks the font. The port's Entry `get_desired_size` returns
  exactly 34pt (matches the bare field) — provably correct for this OS.
- The standalone `entry` page (a `VerticalStackLayout` of plain Entries) is GREEN — MAUI's Entries there
  are also 34pt. So MAUI's base Entry measure IS 34pt; the extra 6pt appears ONLY inside the Grid rows.

So MAUI's SHIPPED (10.0.71) Grid lays an Auto row of a text input ~6pt taller than `sizeThatFits` (a row
min / baseline pad / RowSpacing default not present in the read-only `src/` snapshot, whose Grid
`RowSpacing` default is 0 — matching the port). Per ruling 11 the render wins, but reproducing it means
changing the port's Grid Auto-row measure/default board-wide — every Grid on every platform — which is a
high-blast-radius change that must be user-ruled, not made autonomously. The port's per-control Entry
measure is correct and must NOT be inflated (would regress the green `entry` page). Deferred pending a
ruling on the Grid row behavior. NOTE: content otherwise matches (pure offset).
